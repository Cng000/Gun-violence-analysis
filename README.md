# Gun Violence Analysis (Project Proposal)

*Team members*: Carlos, Emma, Kenny, and Victor  
*Team name*: DeaThStaR

## Project theme

The major theme of this project is gun violence in the United States. Specifically, we intend to explore and analyze two datasets - the first dealing with gun incidents between January 2013 and March 2018, and the second with FBI background check data - to study how gun violence varied by state and how it has trended over the last few years. Also of interest is the analysis of how gun incidents relate to the ways guns were obtained by individuals.

## Potential questions

* What kind of guns are commonly used during incidents?
* How is the number of gun permits per state correlated to gun incidents?
* What are the most reoccurring types of gun violence incidents within the United States?
* What counties/cities/states have the highest rates of gun incidents?
* What general trend best describes gun violence within the US? Has it increased, decreased, or remained constant?

## Datasets

* [Gun violence data](https://github.com/jamesqo/gun-violence-data)
* [FBI NICS firearm background check data](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks)
* [2016 mean income data](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/median-annual-income/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D)
* [Population Estimates](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=PEP_2017_PEPANNRES&prodType=table)


## Predictors and targets

* *Predictors*: n_guns_involved, participant_age, totals (total of permits)
* *Targets*: n_of_incidents, n_killed, n_injured

## Explanation

The questions and datasets presented above are relevant to the broader theme of our project because they deal directly with gun violence within the US. More specifically, they are relevant because every single question/dataset addresses a concrete aspect of gun violence. For instance, our gun violence dataset provides factual information about gun violence incidents occurring between 2013 and 2018. The second dataset, namely the FBI NICS firearm background check data, allows us to infer, for example, whether states with high gun sales are correlated with high violence incidents. Additionally, all of our questions explore specific aspects of gun violence, ranging from the types of guns involved in incidents to what types of incidents are the most recurrent, etc.
